My professional portfolio

This is my 301 Professional Portfolio project. I am learning how to use jQuery functions in my work with this project.





**Credits:**
*Nicholas Hunt-Walker*: I used ideas in the code base from the Kilavolt Blog lab code and refactored them into my code for certain areas and snippets. Specifically, help with structuring the constructor,
*MDN web docs*: I researched most of my code base on their website. I researched for code structure, code definition and general ideas for code usage.
